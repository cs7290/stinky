## Testing

From the root directory run:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Or with Node.js installed, run:

```bash
npm start
```

## Build SCSS using SASS

Make sure you have installed all dependencies with `npm install`. Then run on of the following:

```bash
npm run sass-dev # compiles uncompressed css
npm run sass-prod # compiles compressed (i.e. "minified") css
```
