# Stinky
### A project of the Roux Institute at Northeastern University
---
Stinky maps smell complaints in the Portland, Maine metropolitan area in an attempt to identify pollutants, health hazards, and other quality of life impacts to Maine residents and visitors. It uses up-to-the-minute complaint data from [SmellMyCity](https://www.smellmycity.org), as well as other data, to seek and show patterns in Portland-area smells.

If you'd like to make a smell report, download the SmellMyCity app via the iOS App Store or the Google Play store. If you want to contribute code to Stinky, we welcome you to check the issues list associated with this repo. You should also feel free to suggest issues or submit pull requests directly.

The map and charts displayed on the site run from an [Observable](https://observablehq.com) notebook and use MapLibre and D3.
